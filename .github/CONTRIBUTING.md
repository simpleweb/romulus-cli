# Contributing to romulus-cli

We are open to, and grateful for, any contributions made by the community. By contributing to romulus-cli, you agree to abide by the [code of conduct](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Reporting Issues and Asking Questions

Before opening an issue, please search the [issue tracker](https://github.com/simpleweb/generator-react-native/issues) to make sure your issue hasn't already been reported.

### Bugs and Improvements

We use the issue tracker to keep track of bugs and improvements to romulus-cli itself, its examples, and the documentation. We encourage you to open issues to discuss improvements, architecture, theory, internal implementation, etc. If a topic has been discussed before, we will ask you to join the previous discussion.

### Sending a Pull Request

Do what you need to do code wise and then add a new `changeset` (we use [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to help version the package consistently).

```shell
yarn changegset
```

For non-trivial changes, please open an issue with a proposal for a new feature or refactoring before starting on the work. We don't want you to waste your efforts on a pull request that we won't want to accept.

On the other hand, sometimes the best way to start a conversation _is_ to send a pull request. Use your best judgement!

In general, the contribution workflow looks like this:

- Open a new issue in the [Issue tracker](https://github.com/simpleweb/generator-react-native/issues).
- Fork the repo.
- Create a new feature branch based off the `master` branch.
- Submit a pull request, referencing any issues it addresses.

Please try to keep your pull request focused in scope and avoid including unrelated commits.

After you have submitted your pull request, we'll try to get back to you as soon as possible. We may suggest some changes or improvements.
